        <h1>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is all set to release on November, 2022</h1>
        <img class="div1" src="image1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The tribes of Wakanda are getting ready to meet a brand-new iteration of their country’s savior in Black
            Panther: Wakanda Forever, a film that is a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ryan Coogler is back in

            charge of directing the adored comic book character for the follow-up to 2018’s Black Panther after the
            tragic
            passing of Chadwick Boseman.
            The first trailer showed that, despite the fact that a different individual will be sporting the iconic
            suit, the legacy of the first Black Panther is still clearly audible. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever also
            gets the honor of
            bringing the Marvel Cinematic Universe to a close before we go on to Phase 5’s lineup of
            Blade, Thunderbolts, and other movies.

            If you’re ready to practice your best Wakandan salute, the cast, narrative, release date, and other facts
            for <br> Black Panther: Wakanda Forever are given below.

        </p>
        <h1>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever plot</h1>
        <p>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever’s absence of Chadwick’s T’Challa frees us to look into the other Wakandan
            legends. The sequel might include new characters and locations while delving further into Wakandan mythology
            and tradition.
            According to recent movie sources, Tenoch Huerta will play Namor the Sub-Mariner, the main adversary. This
            claim also implies that Namor’s kingdom and home, Atlantis, would be included in the Black Panther universe.
            Although Namor currently appears in comic books, we might expect a huge change since Namor will be a part of
            the MCU.</p>
        <h1>Release Date of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</h1>
        <p>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever will be made accessible on November 11, 2022.

            The movie was initially confirmed in May 2021, and the initial date for its release was May 2022. Production
            was, however, halted from November 2021 to January 2022 as a result of Covid. Letitia Wright, who portrayed
            the lead in the film, also had adequate time to recover from an injury sustained on the set. We’re hopeful
            there won’t be any further delays until the film’s release because the main filming for it was finished in
            March 2022.</p>
